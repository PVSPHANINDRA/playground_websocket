# Playground_WebSocket

Welcome to Playground_WebSocket! This repository is used to store various experimental runs made on WebSocket technology. Each experiment is stored in a separate branch, allowing for easy organization and tracking of different WebSocket experiments.

## About WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It enables interactive communication between a client and a server, allowing for real-time data transfer.

## Repository Structure

- **master Branch**: The master branch serves as the main branch of the repository. It may contain general information about the project and serve as a starting point for new experiments.

- **Experiment Branches**: Each experiment is stored in its own branch. These branches contain the code, configurations, and documentation related to specific WebSocket experiments. Experiment branches are named descriptively to indicate the purpose or focus of the experiment.
